Lecture on Web Application Security
===================================

Across a few examples, this lecture illustrates the most frequent attack types on web applications, and the techniques to mitigate them.

Setup
-----

Create a virtualhost for the application. Note that `mod_security` must be disabled for the examples to work.

    <VirtualHost *:80>
      ServerName security
      DocumentRoot "/path/to/security/web"
      DirectoryIndex index.php
      <Directory "/path/to/security/web">
        AllowOverride All
        Allow from All
      </Directory>
    
      <IfModule security2_module>
        SecRuleEngine Off
      </IfModule>
    
    </VirtualHost>

Update your hosts file, restart the server, then navigate to http://security, and you're done.
